# Jackson Library for JSON Processing in Java

## Overview

Jackson is a popular open-source Java library for handling JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. It provides tools for parsing JSON data into Java objects (deserialization) and converting Java objects back to JSON (serialization). Jackson is widely used in various Java applications, especially in web development and RESTful web services.

## Key Features

1. **Streaming API:**
   - Jackson provides a high-performance streaming API for reading and writing JSON data efficiently, making it suitable for large datasets.

2. **Data Binding:**
   - Supports automatic conversion between JSON and Java objects through data binding, simplifying the handling of JSON data.

3. **Tree Model:**
   - Offers a tree model representation for JSON data, allowing for easy traversal and manipulation of JSON structures.

4. **Annotation Support:**
   - Jackson supports annotations to customize the mapping between Java objects and JSON properties, providing fine-grained control over serialization and deserialization.

5. **Multiple Formats:**
   - While primarily known for JSON processing, Jackson has modules/extensions for handling other data formats such as XML, YAML, and more.

6. **Integration with Frameworks:**
   - Commonly integrated with Java frameworks like Spring for developing RESTful web services, making JSON data exchange seamless.

## Main Modules

1. **`jackson-databind`:**
   - Core module for data binding, providing functionality for converting between JSON and Java objects using streaming and tree models.

2. **`jackson-core`:**
   - Low-level module providing streaming and parsing functionalities used by `jackson-databind`.

## Usage Example

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class JacksonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create an instance of ObjectMapper
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

        // Sample Java object
        MyObject myObject = new MyObject("John Doe", 25);

        // Serialize the object to JSON
        String jsonString = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(myObject);

        // Deserialize JSON to Java object
        MyObject deserializedObject = objectMapper.readValue(jsonString, MyObject.class);
    }
}
